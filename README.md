# BlockSwapper

![blockswapper.png](blockswapper.png)

BlockSwapper is a simple, lightweight plugin that automatically refills a players hotbar when they are building, if they have additional blocks of the same type in their inventory.

It does this by detecting when a survival mode player places the last block in a stack and automatically searches their inventory for stacks of the same material. It then moves the first stack it finds into their hotbar.
